# Students-Performance-in-Exams-Analysis-
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting students' academic performance using a real-world dataset containing socio-demographic and academic preparation attributes such as gender,etc

Here is a sample README.md file for your project, assuming it's a data analysis project using a Jupyter Notebook (performance.ipynb) and the dataset StudentsPerformance.csv:

Student Performance Analysis
This project analyzes student performance based on various demographic and academic factors using a dataset of student test scores. It uses Python with libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in a Jupyter Notebook.

📊 Dataset Description
The dataset StudentsPerformance.csv includes the following columns:

gender

race/ethnicity

parental level of education

lunch

test preparation course

math score

reading score

writing score

✨ Features
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation between scores and demographic factors

Data visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib

📌 Notes
Ensure you have Jupyter installed to view and interact with the notebook.

The dataset is clean and does not require preprocessing for basic analysis.
